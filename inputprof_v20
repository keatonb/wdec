For a visual of how profiles can be parameterized, see intro to chemprofiles_subroutines.f90.
Tell how much you want to smooth the profile (10. - very smooth to 500. - not smooth)
200.d0
The two values below define buffer zones around locations of transition zones in the chemical profiles. The first one is buffer_inner (in Mr units) and the second is buffer_outer (in -log(1-Mr/M*) units). If there is a weird spike in the carbon abundance profile, try increasing buffer_inner. If there is a discontinuity at the He/H interface, try increasing buffer_outer. If Helium suddenly jumps up to 1 at C/He interface, try decreasing buffer_outer.
